  description:
    - Given a list of releases, find all releases that match provided criteria.
  positional: _input, _criteria, _key
  options:
    _input:
      description: The input filter list
      type: list
      required: true
    _criteria:
      description: The match criteria.  Can be 'latest', 'eq', 'gte', 'lte'.
      type: str
      required: true
    _key:
      description: |
        Exclude if _matchtype is 'latest'.  _key can be x.y.z, x.y or x.  If _matchtype is 'eq', then
        all versions that equal the key are returned.  If key is x.y.z, that is any version matching
        that exact major.minor.point (including decorated version, if the option is set to include them).
        If _matchtype is 'gte', any version greater-than-or-equal to _key are returned.  Again, if _key
        is x.y.z, then any version x.y.n is returned where n >= z, as well as any version x.a.n where
        a > y, as well as any version b.a.n where b > x.  If _matchtype is 'lte', the same logic applies
        but for versions less-than-or-equal.
      type: str
    include_decorated_versions:
      description: |
        Whether the match criteria should consider versions with a "decorator".  This is a string following the version name.
        For example, v0.60.0-alpha.0 or v0.53.2-rc.  The default is False.  If this is set to True, then the applied criteria
        treats these as the version without the decorator.
      type: bool
    normalize:
      description: |
        Remove all elaborations to semantic version (except the decoarator, if 'include_decorated_versions' is True).
        When set To True, all returned versions will be X.Y.Z (excluding for example, a leading 'v' literal).  The
        default is True.
      type: bool

EXAMPLES: |
  # latest, returns ['4.4.0']
  {{ ['v1.1.0', 'v2.2.0', 'v3.3.0', 'v4.2.0', 'v4.2.2', 'v4.4.0', 'v4.5.0-alpha1'] | github_release_version('latest') }}

  # get all versions 4.2.x, returns ['4.2.0', '4.2.2']
  {{ ['v1.1.0', 'v2.2.0', 'v3.3.0', 'v4.2.0', 'v4.2.2', 'v4.4.0', 'v4.5.0-alpha1'] | github_release_version('eq', '4.2') }}
