# Collections Plugins Directory

Currently there are two plugins defined:
- `lookup/github_releases`: interacts with the [github releases API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases) to enumerate a list of available Releases for a repository.
- `filter/github_release_version`: reads a list of github releases and returns version that match an operator-based criteria.
